    "# Demonstration - Integration Tests with Databricks Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "This demonstration guides users through creating a Model Training Pipeline Workflow in Databricks using three notebooks: **01 Silver to Feature Store for preparing features**, **02 Features Validation**, and **03 Train Model on Validated Features**. The workflow begins by setting up a Databricks job with the first notebook, adding necessary parameters, and ensuring successful execution. Dependent tasks are then added sequentially for the remaining notebooks, with each task configured to use appropriate parameters and run on the specified cluster. This process demonstrates how to build an end-to-end pipeline in Databricks Workflows, integrating data preparation, validation, and model training in a scalable and structured manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this demonstration, you will be able to: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand how to navigate the Databricks Workflows interface to create and manage jobs.\n",
    "- Learn how to configure a Databricks job with tasks, including setting task dependencies and parameters.\n",
    "- Develop the ability to integrate multiple notebooks into a single workflow for building an end-to-end pipeline.\n",
    "- Demonstrate how to use Databricks Workflows to automate data preparation, feature validation, and model training tasks.\n",
    "- Gain hands-on experience in parameterizing tasks to customize workflow execution for different data schemas and configurations.\n",
    "- Understand the importance of task dependencies in ensuring sequential execution within a pipeline.\n",
    "- Learn to troubleshoot and validate task success before progressing to subsequent steps in the workflow.\n"

    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a Simple Job**:\n",
    "   - We started by creating a workflow that read silver-layered data from **Unity Catalog**, transformed it, and created a **feature table** stored in the **Databricks Feature Store**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Validating Features**:\n",
    "   - We attached a second notebook to the workflow to validate that the features in the feature table were behaving as expected, such as confirming normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training a Model**:\n",
    "   - A third notebook was added to train a model using the validated features, and the resulting model was stored in **Unity Catalog** for centralized management.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this workflow, we demonstrated how to build and validate an end-to-end pipeline for machine learning using Databricks Workflows, ensuring both the data and model meet expectations at every step."
