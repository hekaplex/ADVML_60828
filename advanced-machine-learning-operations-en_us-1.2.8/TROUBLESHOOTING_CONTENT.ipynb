    "### **Issue: Loading the Widget Takes Longer than Expected**\n",
    "#### **Possible Cause**:\n",
    "- The notebook is running on an incompatible Databricks Runtime version.\n",
    "- The widget is too large, leading to longer loading times.\n",
    "- The internet connection is slow, causing delays in loading.\n",
    "- A transient issue in the current notebook session or cached state.\n",
    "#### **Suggested Solution**:\n",
    "1. **Verify Databricks Runtime Version**:\n",
    "   - Make sure your cluster is running on **DBR 17.3 ML**\n",
    "2. **Re-run the Cell**:\n",
    "   - Sometimes, re-running the cell can resolve issues related to temporary glitches.\n",
    "3. **Wait for the Widget to Load**:\n",
    "   - If the widget is large or your internet connection is slow, allow additional time for the widget to load.\n",
    "4. **Install Required Dependencies**:\n",
    "   - Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed. Run the following command to install `pygwalker`:\n",
    "   %pip install pygwalker==0.1.11\n",
    "5. **Clone and Rerun the Notebook**:\n",
    "   - If none of the above steps resolve the issue, **clone this notebook** and rerun the cloned version. This action often helps clear any cached states or transient issues in the current notebook session.\n",
    "6. **Contact Databricks Support**:\n",
    "   - If the problem persists, reach out to Databricks support for further assistance."
